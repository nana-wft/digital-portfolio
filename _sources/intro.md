```{tab-item} Things I learned
Directives are great tools to make the Jupyter Book look more attractive and clear.
Section labels helped cross reference the sections within the files easily.
Topic Guides and Instructions from the assignment are pretty clear for me to complete this assignment.

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
I was a bit stuck when I rebuilt the book after updating the Titanic Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis and got an error.
I tried different ways to fix it including installing ipykernel, redoing the .ipynb file and using No Kernel for the file.
Overall, this assignment is lengthy and requires a lot of patience and hard work from my end.
